## Description

In the early stages of producing a web application, it can be helpful to have placeholder assets while working on the structure and functionality of your application. This application provides users with a way to quickly create temporary logos in the form of SVG (scalable vector graphics) files that can be used in developing their application. Users can input upwards to 3 characters into the logo customize the logo with a predefined selection of colors for the background shape and for the characters to suit their purposes.

The repository does not include the modules from the Inquirer or Jest NPM. Install them into the clone repository by running `npm i` in a GitBash terminal within Visual Studio Code. 


## Usage

When the installaion process from above is complete, the user can now this application. Open the code in Visual Studio Code and open a GitBash terminal. 

Next, enter `node idex.js` in the terminal and follow the prompts. If the user enters more than 3 characters in that related prompt, the terminal will not move on to the next prompt until the user corrects the input.
